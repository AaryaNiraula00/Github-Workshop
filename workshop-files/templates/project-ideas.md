- **Files to create:** `calculator.py`, `test_calculator.py`, `README.md`

## Intermediate Projects ðŸŒ¿

### 5. Blog Site Generator
- Create a simple static blog generator
- Practice: Advanced branching, rebasing, tagging
- **Structure:**
  ```
  blog/
  â”œâ”€â”€ posts/
  â”œâ”€â”€ templates/
  â”œâ”€â”€ generator.py
  â””â”€â”€ config.yaml
  ```

### 6. Weather App
- Build a weather application using APIs
- Practice: Environment variables, .gitignore, branches
- **Files to consider:** `.env.example`, `app.py`, `requirements.txt`

### 7. Library Management System

- Practice: Database migrations, feature development
- **Structure:**
  ```
  library/
  â”œâ”€â”€ models/
  â”œâ”€â”€ views/
  â”œâ”€â”€ controllers/

  ```

## Advanced Projects ðŸš€

### 8. Contribution to Open Source
- Find a beginner-friendly open source project
- Practice: Forking, pull requests, code reviews
- **Skills:** Working with large codebases, following contribution guidelines

### 9. Microservice Architecture
- Build multiple small services that work together
- Practice: Multiple repositories, submodules, CI/CD
- **Repositories:** `user-service`, `auth-service`, `api-gateway`

### 10. Documentation Site
- Create comprehensive documentation for a project
- Practice: Documentation as code, automated deployment
- **Tools:** Markdown, static site generators, GitHub Pages

## Workshop Exercise Suggestions

### For Each Project:

1. **Planning Phase:**
   - Create an issue describing the project
   - Break down into smaller tasks
   - Create a project board

2. **Development Phase:**
   - Create feature branches for each component
   - Make regular, meaningful commits
   - Write clear commit messages

3. **Collaboration Phase:**
   - Work with a partner
   - Practice pull requests and code reviews
   - Resolve merge conflicts

4. **Release Phase:**
   - Create releases with tags
   - Write release notes
   - Deploy or publish the project

## Tips for Success

- **Start Small:** Begin with the simplest version and iterate
- **Commit Often:** Make small, focused commits with clear messages
- **Document Everything:** Good documentation helps others understand your work
- **Ask for Help:** Don't hesitate to ask questions or request code reviews
- **Have Fun:** Learning Git should be enjoyable!
